# Accessing the Pythia Suite Marketing Page

To view the premium Apple-style marketing page for Pythia, add the following query parameter to the URL:

```
?page=suite
```

For example:
- Local development: `http://localhost:5173/?page=suite`
- Production: `https://yourdomain.com/?page=suite`

The Suite page is accessible without authentication and features:
- Cinematic hero with scroll-driven animations
- Sticky sections with changing visuals
- Five feature "moments" with animated UI mocks
- Modular dashboard showcase
- Trust/security section
- Final CTA with dramatic styling
- Scroll progress indicator
- Chapter navigation
- Reduced motion support

All animations use smooth, deliberate easing (no bouncy effects) and respect the user's `prefers-reduced-motion` settings.
